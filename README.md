# World-Energy-Consumption-POC

This project focuses on examining energy production and usage trends over the past century, accross types and countries.

World energy consumption is fascinating with regards to how much each country produces and consumes. Our project looks at energy production and consumption of each country between 1900-2020.  Now I’m sure you’re saying “WOW, that’s going to be A LOT of data…” and we’d agree with you!

We found the information to be overwhelming with 122 columns! So, we put our heads together to pull out the pieces of info that meant the most to us.
We wanted to look at both fossil fuels and renewable resources, but just the actual production and consumption.

Once we parsed down the dataset we included the iso_code(which is a three letter country code), the country name, year, country population that year, gdp, the production of coal, gas, & oil, as well as the electricity generated by and consumption of coal, gas, oil, hydro, solar, wind and nuclear resources.

Just so we’re all on the same page, you can see the description of the columns we included for each fossil fuel and renewable resource.
Electricity is the electricity generated from each resource and is measured in terawatt-hours 
Consumption is the primary energy consumption of each resource and is also measured in terawatt-hours

Data Profiling and Quality Assessment

This profiling made it apparent the majority of the values were null. While the dataset technically goes back to 1900, we discovered that there were no values in rows before the year 1980. While we did include these null values in the creation of our database, we only included data beyond 1980 for our visualizations.
